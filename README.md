# Critical Mass Fall 2021 Internship - Ivan Gibson

## Work / Project Examples

### ManUp
[ManUp Site](https://stylesquadmanup.herokuapp.com)

   The purpose of the ManUp group was to combat toxic masculinity in high school and below aged kids. The needed a website where they could have their message and resources in one location. This was a project with 3 other people. I took on the role of setting tasks and milestones in the project and assigning tasks to everyone including myself. We had regular client presentations to keep the client updated on all progress and to make sure their vision we being represented. I was the main presenter for all presentations and was also tasked with showcasing the progress the group had made.

[My Portfolio](ivangibson.com)

   My personal Portfolio. I made this as a way to showcase my own work as a developer. I feel anyone even people working at a large company with no desire to work for them self should still have a portfolio. My first attempt I wanted to keep things standard so people are not looking where to go when they just want to send me a message. I plan to keep updating this throughout my career as I continue to learn and grow.
This was designed and built by me. I started off with a simple sparse wireframe design as I am more of a minimalist and wanted the site to be clean and succinct as a way to represent myself.

This is a portfolio I discovered and it was fascinating to just watch as you scroll up and down and move the mouse over elements on the page.

This cool little JS game was very interesting to see. I had never really thought of doing something like this. It got me thinking outside the box.
