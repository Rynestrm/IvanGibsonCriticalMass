# Critical Mass Fall 2021 Internship - Ivan Gibson

## Work / Project Examples

### ManUp
[ManUp Site](https://stylesquadmanup.herokuapp.com)

   The purpose of the ManUp group is to combat toxic masculinity and educate elementary to high school aged kids about it. The organization needed a website to help get their message out and a place to store all their audiovisual resources in one location.
   
   This project was done with 3 other people all filling various rolls. I took on the role of project lead, project coordinator and a front end developer. I was setting up milestones and then tasks to complete each milestone and deadlines for each of them, then assigning tasks to everyone including myself. I set up the basic layout of the overall site and the individual page layout. I also took the lead on the most of the CSS styling being done.

   We had weekly group meetings that I lead and we also had monthly presentations for the client to keep them updated on all progress that had been made and to ensure their vision was still being represented. I was the main presenter for all presentations and was also tasked with showcasing the progress the group had made.


### Portfolio
[My Portfolio](ivangibson.com)

   My personal Portfolio. I made this as a way to showcase my own current and future work as a developer. I feel anyone even people with no desire to work freelance should still have a portfolio. We create new and interesting things all the time and people should be proud to show it off. With this first version of my portfolio, I wanted to keep things looking standard and familiar so people are not confused on their first visit and looking where to go when they just want to send me a message. I plan to keep updating this throughout my career as I continue to learn and grow as well as change the design to keep it modern.
   
   This was designed and built by me and as I am more of a minimalist person and wanted the site to be clean and succinct as a way to represent myself. I’m also a very lighthearted person so writing the about me section in the style of the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” was incredibly fun and I still smile when I read it. I started off the site plan with a simple and sparse wireframe design using a white board for the rough ideas, then using adobe XD for a better layout and placement of elements. The current version was the 3rd idea I came up with and it quickly became my favorite.


## Inspiration

   This is a portfolio I stumbled across recently and I found it fascinating to just watch how it changes as you scroll up and down or move the mouse over elements on the page. The middle circle acting like a “window” showing the photo negative color scheme of any element you can view through it including images was something I had never seen it done before and immediately caught my eye.

   I spent a long time just looking how it interacted with each element and wondering about how it might be done while forgetting it was a portfolio for a developer and not just a fun app to play with.

   This cool little JS game was very interesting to see. I had never really thought of doing something like this. It got me thinking outside the box, about all the components needing to work together. Tracking mouse movements and tracking the shot and cube movements and watching for them to collide. I find myself playing with it but not trying to win, I was just watching how it all interacted.
   
## Focus

   If I had the time and resources to learn or build anything I would have to say I would love to get a rock-solid understanding of CSS and vanilla JavaScript. So many things are based off of them, that understanding exactly how they work will make learning everything from the current Bootstrap 5 version, to a future version of React.js 30 or even a new JavaScript library that doesn’t exist yet, will be much simpler.

   If I could build anything I think it would have to be an accessibility app that I have had in my head for a while now. In my mind is it like “Yelp” but for people with accessibility issues. They cab post about how easy or hard public places are for them to get into or move around once you are there. I never have to think about a store front having a small lip at the front door or bathrooms being downstairs so a simple app that can get rid of any anxiety of someone who wants to visit a new place seems like an amazing idea to me.


Thank you for taking the time to read this
